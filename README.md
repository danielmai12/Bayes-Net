# Bayes-Net

Implement a **simple fraud detection system** with a variable elimination algorithm.

To run:
- Define your factors in any bayes network
- Run the inference given the factor list of the bayes net, the query variables, the ordered hidden variables and the evidence list
  - Note: evidence list will be 2d array where each element in the list will be a list of [variable, value].
